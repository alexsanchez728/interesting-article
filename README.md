# NSS-Exercise: interesting-article

## Project Description:
 This project was split in two parts, for the first part we focused on building out the HTML using different HTML tags like p, h1, h2, sections, headers, and footers. For the second part we practiced how to style our HTML.

## Project Requirements Included:
For part 1:
* Create a header with the site's title and footer for the site's copyright notice.
* Each article has a header containing a title, each article has a footer containing the author and publication date.
* Each article has at least one section

For part 2:
* Styling inlcudes adding:
1. A different background color
2. A different font family
3. A different font size
4. A different font color
5. A different line height
6. A different padding value
7. Each should have a border, but with rounded corners of different size

## Final Product

A pretty ugly site to be honest but it's a first step towards front-end development and design.
